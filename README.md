# Open Exposure Data (OED)

The OED format was developed by a working group of industry practitioners chaired by Matthew Jones with the technical work led by Aiste Kalinauskaite, as a robust and documented input framework for Oasis based platforms and models.                
                
Responsibility for OED has been handed over from NASDAQ to Oasis LMF who now curate and govern this standard - so there will be no further changes to the assets in this repository.

The new repository for Open Data Standards, including OED can be found at:
